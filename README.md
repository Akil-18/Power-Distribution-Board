# Power-Distribution-Board

**INTRODUCTION**

The power distribution board PCB, designed using KiCad for Technocrats Robotics, efficiently manages and distributes three distinct voltage levels - 5V, 12V, and 24V. The board features an optimized PCB layout that provides a compact design, maximizing space utilization within the Roverâ€™s enclosure. This ensures that all critical components of the Rover receive the appropriate power supply for optimal operation.
